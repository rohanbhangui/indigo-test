This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- installation of `node`

To compile a codebase please run `npm install` in the root of the folder followed by `npm start`

Alternatively, one can run `npm build` and run a server in the root of the compiled files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Additional Notes

- I used react because it provided a quick scafholding that can quickly get an app like this upright
- Used styled components for more dynamic styling cases that are required for this app (eg. the pop up and such)
- Could have added a search functionality or filters to make the app better.
- Use a more immersive approach for the over all experience
- I would have added tests given more time
- Used redux for fetching the data and storing it properly
- Using `useContext` for storing some of the states of some of the objects that i used `useState` for
